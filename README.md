# WebRTC Media Stream Proof of Concept (POC)

This project demonstrates the use of WebRTC to access and control the camera and microphone. It leverages Bun and Hone for a fast and efficient back-end setup, Tailwind CSS for styling, and modern JavaScript practices, including modules and classes.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Bun](https://bun.sh): Bun needs to be installed on your system to run the server and manage dependencies.
- A modern web browser that supports WebRTC and ES modules.

## Installation

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/daosgava/webrtc-poc.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd webrtc-poc

# Install dependencies with Bun
bun install
```

## Usage

Start the server with Bun:

```sh
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
